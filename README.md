# INXMail SMTP Provider

The INXMail SMTP provider allows you to use the [INXMail SMTP Relay service](https://www.inxmail.com/products/mail-relay) with Preside Email Center.

Once installed, the extension will add an INXMail tab to your email settings page. Configure your SMTP credentials and API keys and you are good to go.
